Conclusion
Overall Performance:
The second model (loadh5.py) significantly outperforms the first model (load_train_model.py) in terms of both validation and test accuracy and loss.
Generalization: The second model generalizes well to unseen data, as indicated by its high validation and test accuracies.
In contrast, the first model has severe overfitting issues or possible validation data handling problems, given its 0% validation accuracy.
The second model(loadh5) is the better choice based on these results. â€‹
